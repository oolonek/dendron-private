# Mail Daniel Mietchen

Hi Daniel,

Hope your are well ?
This mail is not related (well not directly) with the LOTUS project (NP occurences upload on wikidata), but in fact somehow related, since it is via this project that I got in touch with you ...
Looking at your profiles, papers and repos, I have been very inspired by yours and Egon's research endeavors. I see your work like going "a step further" than doing open-science by just let's say, having a paper or two in Frontiers ... And this is a direction I would like to follow.

Starting part time in April and full time in August this year, I am taking a new position at university of Fribourg in the department of Biology where I will head the metabolomics platform (everything to rebuild there but not from scratch) at 50% of my time and have 50% for my own research and in between fit some additional % for teaching. I am very happy, because it will give me the freedom in research I have been looking forward to from some time now, and it overall a good "change of air" after 7 years in Geneva.

I am willing to follow the directions you guys point regarding open-science.
I have been setting up a small git and associated gitpage gathering published dendron notes (a notetaking tool) over here https://oolonek.github.io/dendron/ (you will find dendron info and a bunch of unrelated stuff there fro now ...)
I guess that what I would like to set up is as a kind of open electronic lab-book, but also a place to throw in some thoughts and ideas even if not well detailed and very preliminary. Also if they are not directly linked to the topics of my research. I would be curious to see if there would be some feedback from like-minded researchers, or collaborators interested in one or the others of the developed ideas. The point being to "work with the garage door opened" https://oolonek.github.io/dendron/notes/88ed503e-7fea-4a52-aead-a4a5d31a9b8e.html. So not only to disseminate the research outputs in an open manner but also, to disseminate them early and not necessarily in their final polished form.
I would like to experiment on this for one/some of the research projects I will start at Uni Fribourg. 
I fully understand that some collaborators might be reluctant to diffuse their research results in unfinished form so I guess that at the metabolomics platform I wont be able to do this for all project but I would like at least to propose this possibility to my collaborators and hope that some of them will be OK with it.
Else I'll do it for the project that I lead or were I work alone.

I have various questions in mind that I would like to discuss with you.

- First have your feedback on the feasibility and interest of such approach in the frame of an analytical platform and in general.
- What would be the best adapted licenses to diffuse this material (is it very important ? can we have various licences ?)
- What arguments would you suggest to convince academic collaborators ?
- It is also possible that I have client from the industry at the platform. My feeling is that it's OK to work and take money from the private sector but that this should be somehow published. We have received x $ from z project which had for objective to study effects of a on b. So maybe not all details but at least publish this info. What do you think about this ? I have no clue about how the University of Fribourg and the potential industry clients would take this ?
- I am also very interested in orienting my research towards more concrete impacts and values that I personally feel as necessary to follow. Here I mean, at our tiny small scale, reorienting our system in better directions, or changing the parts and bits of the system in the other cases ... I am specifically interest in biodiversity conservation. Because 1. I feel it's an urgent matter. 2. I feel some of my research could help on this problematic (however it is clearly not enough to characterize biodiv to save it ... so i will need to find complementary and like-minded fellows here) I understand you share this will of carrying a societal oriented research. I would like to exchange with you on this also. Have your feedback.

I guess other questions will come during the discussion if we can chat.

Would you be interested in exchanging on these topics ?
If you are we could try to find a slot next week ? It is pretty free on my side for now.


Have a nice day,

Pierre-Marie
