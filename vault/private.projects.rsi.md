# RSI Foundation 

Resilience, Sustainability and Innovation Foundation. A rpoject initiated in part by late Alexander "Sasha" Kagansky who got in touch with me together with Adrien Henni.

**2021-01-13 09:15** At this current date I have no clear position on this prject. Should I invest some time on it or not. Is it really corresponding to what I have in mind ? Mixed feelings about some of the actors.

I talked about it to :
- Paul Coulerie
- Jacques Falquet
- Bruno David
