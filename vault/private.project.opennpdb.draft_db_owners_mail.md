Dear XXX people,


We are in the process of compiling a comprehensive database of natural products structure-organism referenced pairs. For this we have been agglomerating >30 publicly available databases of which the one you have been publishing. This data has been standardized and curated and will be uploaded to Wikidata as an open and living repository.

Prior to publication of the extracted and further curated results we wanted to check in with you and understand wether you agreed or not on the use we made of this data. You would be of course listed, with full contact details, in the contributors list of the publication we are preparing.

In case you do agree please answer so by responding this email. 
In case you do not agree please answer so by responding this email, we would then not consider your database from our project and remove your details from the contributors list.

In any case many thanks for your contribution to the natural products community.

Looking forward to read your answer,
Best regards,


Pierre-Marie Allard

Prior to publication of the extracted and further curated results we wanted to check in with you to understand the sharing licence attached to your database as we couldn't find those details online. This would help us to build a contributors list in the publication we are preparing, with, for each database, the full contact details and exact associated licence. In case you do not answer we would fill in the contact details that were found online.

Many thanks for your contribution to the natural products community.

Looking forward to read your answer,
Best regards,
