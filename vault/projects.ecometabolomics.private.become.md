Emanuel Defossez Sinergia project.


In the frame on this project. I proposed to give Manu access to the land I baught in Ecuador near Puyo.
He needs a letter of autorization.

# Letter Manu


To whom it may concern.


With this letter I, Dr. Pierre-Marie Allard, would like to express my support to Dr. Emmanuel Deffossez's groundbreaking ecometabolomics project BECOME "BEcoMe : Biodiversity, Ecology and Metabolomics" and give authorization for sample collection to Dr. Deffossez and his team in the fram of the BECOME project.
Our biological station, Arutam Chontayacu Biological Station (ACBS), is a 60 hectares plot of tropical forest neighbouring the Llaganates National Parc (https://www.ambiente.gob.ec/16764/) a unique national reserve of over 210000 ha. ACBS is located between the foothill of the Andes mountains an the Amazon lowlands basin. It is situated between 1090 and 1200 masl on the south banks of the Chontayacu river, an affluent of the Anzu river. The lands are part of the Mera canton, Pastaza province. This biotope is very particular, pluviosity is above 5000 mm / year and a median T째 of 21 째C. Extreme endemism and high biodiversity are present on the banks of the cristalline waters of the Chontayacu river, this biodiversity is clearly understudied. The ACBS biological station is working in close collaboration with two local biodiversity conservation associations: Ecominga (https://ecomingafoundation.wordpress.com/) and Sumak Kawsay In Situ (https://www.sumakkawsayinsitu.org/english). In Particular Lou Jost (https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=iY2s8acAAAAJ&hl=en), a mathematical ecologist and population geneticist is leading the Ecominga foundation. He is expert in orchid taxonomy and very keen to orient investigation in the region. Alex Bentley is an herpetologist (https://ecomingafoundation.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/undergraduate-student-projects-in-our-reserves-alex-bentley-studying-the-pit-viper-bothrocophias-micropthalmus/) working at Sumak Kawsay, a few kilometers far from ACBS. He will be indispensable to track down snakes, lizzards and multiple amphibians of the sector. Please check the following links to have a glance at the herpetofauna (https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/herpetofauna-de-sumak-kawsay-in-situ-mera), orchids (https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/orquideas-del-sumak-kawsay-in-situ) and mammals (https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/mamiferos-del-sumak-kawsay-in-situ?tab=observations) observed at Sumak. Similar flora and fauna can be expected at ACBS as they are almost identical biotopes. 
In the frame of the BECOME project a radically novel way to chracterize biodiversity is proposed. By jumping directly at the chemical level, it is the interspecific language of the forest which will be listen to and hopefully understood. Indeed semiochemicals are governing above ground and below ground interactions among species. Within these pristine but highly fragile ecosystems, the innovative methodologies of the BECOME project are expected to bring humans are better understanding of the complex interactions at play. In the end such research endeavours are expected to bring novel perspective for a better understanding of the world's biodiversity and it's conservation.
For all the above mentionned reasons, we strongly support the BECOME project. We will happily welcome it's researchers and provide our best support locally at the Arutam Chontayacu Biological Station so that they carry their investigations in ideal conditions.

With best regards,

To whom it may concern.


With this letter, I, Dr. Pierre-Marie Allard, wish to express my support for Dr. Emmanuel Deffossez's innovative ecometabolomics project "BECOME : Biodiversity, Ecology and Metabolomics" and give permission to Dr Deffossez and his team to take samples in the framework of the BECOME project.
Our biological station, the Arutam Chontayacu Biological Station (ACBS), is a 60-hectare plot of tropical forest adjacent to the Llaganates National Park (https://www.ambiente.gob.ec/16764/), a unique national reserve of more than 210,000 ha. ACBS is located between the Andean foothills and the Amazonian Plains Basin. It is located between 1090 and 1200 meters on the south bank of the Chontayacu River, a tributary of the Anzu River. The land is part of the Mera district, in the province of Pastaza. The rainfall is more than 5000 mm / year and the median T째 is 21 째C. Extreme endemism and high biodiversity are present on the banks of the crystalline waters of the Chontayacu River. This biodiversity is under high pressure of human activities (geo-prospection, hydro-electric barrages) as is clearly under-studied. Locally, the ACBS biological station works in close collaboration with two biodiversity conservation associations: Ecominga (https://ecomingafoundation.wordpress.com/) and Sumak Kawsay In Situ (https://www.sumakkawsayinsitu.org/english). Lou Jost (https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=iY2s8acAAAAJ&hl=en), is a mathematical ecologist and population geneticist, he heads the Ecominga foundation. He is an expert in orchid taxonomy and very eager to guide research in the region. Alex Bentley is a herpetologist (https://ecomingafoundation.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/undergraduate-student-projects-in-our-reserves-alex-bentley-studying-the-pit-viper-bothrocophias-micropthalmus/) and works in Sumak Kawsay, a few kilometers from ACBS. He will be indispensable to track snakes, lizards and the many amphibians in the area. Please consult the following links for an overview of the herpetofauna (https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/herpetofauna-de-sumak-kawsay-in-situ-mera), orchids (https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/orquideas-del-sumak-kawsay-in-situ) and mammals (https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/mamiferos-del-sumak-kawsay-in-situ?tab=observations) observed in Sumak. A similar flora and fauna can be expected at ACBS, as they sit within almost identical biotopes. 
In the framework of the BECOME project, a radically new way of characterizing biodiversity is proposed. By directly jumping to the chemical level, it is the interspecific language of the forest that will be listened to and, hopefully, understood. Indeed, semiochemicals determine the interactions between species above and below ground, at both short and long distances. Within these pristine but very fragile ecosystems, the innovative methodologies of the BECOME project should enable humans to better understand the complex interactions at play. Ultimately, these research efforts should provide new insights for a better understanding of global biodiversity and its conservation.
For all the reasons mentioned above, we strongly support the BECOME project. We will gladly welcome its researchers and give them our best support on site at the Arutam Chontayacu Biological Station so that they can conduct their research in ideal conditions.
