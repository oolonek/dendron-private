The authors present an interesting piece of research entitled "Species Prioritization Based on Scaffold Uniqueness Estimated by Molecular Networking: A Case Study with a Collection of 40 Polyporoid Fungal Species". 
This research work exploits the chemical structural and compositional similarity (CSCS) metric, which as been previously published, to prioritize extracts among a collection according to their spectral dissimilarity. The pioritization process led to the selection of a fungal species, Cryptoporus volvatus, which was suspected to contains structural novelty. The authors did not work on the Cryptoporus volvatus culture extract but on the fruiting body extract which appeared richer and isolated trimeric cryptoporic acid derivatives. This works perfectly illustrate the interest of modern spectral based techniques to prioritize and explore collections of natural products extracts libraries. It will clearly be of interest for JNP readers. Scripts and data are correctly (except NMR) shared.

The approach is interesting however it is ambiguous to call it Species Prioritization Based on Scaffold Uniqueness. It would be more correct to call it Species Prioritization Based on Spectral Dissimilarity. This implies some notable differences, indeed it is very complicated to establish Scaffold Uniqueness prior to any annotation process. Actually the CSCS metric is also incorrectly named a chemical structural and compositional similarity (CSCS) metric since it doesn't takes into account chemical structure within it's calculation. Such clarifications should thus be made early in the tools adoption process, otherwise these incorrect designations are propagated and reused within the users community. I would thus recommend to make these clarification in the title and throughout the manuscript.
