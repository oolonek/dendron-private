### First round for the gdocs

Dear all,

As discussed we wanted to start circulating the manuscript among the coauthors at this point.
Here is the google docs link (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuldixDzyHxYfTb2ExKZeqXAJw442dlbWVJNGGVZCX8/edit?usp=sharing)

The aimed paper is Scientific Data (https://www.nature.com/sdata/publish/for-authors#aims-scope) and we have a target word count of 3000 (without Method section and references). Please keep this in mind when writing your sections. We have been mentioning some of you at appropriate sections, however feel free to contribute where you think it is necessary.

We notably would need Egon, Daniel, Rod and Ralph's input on everything which is in general Wikidata related. And maybe more specific comments and addition on the chemistry related aspects (Egon) and taxonomy discussion (Rod).
James, Guido and Jo's inputs would be needed on the NAPRALERT description and it could maybe be of interest to have some historical facts about this DB creation and it's evolution. We will need Jo's input in the data dissemination section, in specific Methods sections, and also some words regarding the position of the published and wd hosted data in a wider and more long term PHO perspective.

This project is not completed yet and we still do not have those 200000+ documented pairs on WD. So we also expect that by exchanging around the manuscript, we can see more clearly the important point that we need to address to have an efficient and working bot.

All native english speakers (and also non native but more talented then we are) please feel free to correct any grammatical errors or poor formulations.

**Important:** please use the "Suggesting mode" on the upper left corner when proceeding to edits. Don't worry if the document starts to become cluttered and colorful, we will integrate step by step.

Daniel, we have not received an answer from your part regarding your participation to the manuscript, so we didn't take the liberty to add you to the authors list. If your schedule is too tight or if you simply don't whish to participate we fully understand. However if you do, please just add your name and affiliation to the gdoc.

Thanks to all for your interest and participation,
We are looking forward to advance with you on this project and make this available to the community.

Have an excellent week-end,

Pierre-Marie

Dear Maria and Chris,


Maria many thanks for your time and zoom last time.
We are excited to have the data uploaded at your place and as an hopefully useful complement to COCONUT.
You asked for a name and we will go for LOTUS this way we :
- abbreviate this naturaL prOducTs occUrrence databaSe (LOTUS)
- keep in line with the COCONUT / LOTUS / ANOTHER VERNACULAR ORGANISM NAME for the DB series
- exemplify the subtleties of taxonomy: Lotus is the vernacular name of Nelumbo nucifera (Nelumbonaceae family) while Lotus is a genus of the Fabaceae family.

So here goes is a first tsv for lotus.naturalproducts.net ! 
It is just a subset but these are entries we have manually curated and for which we individually checked the pertinence of the reference documenting the structure-organism occurrence. It should allow you to have a feeling of the data we have.

Please get back in touch with us if you have any questions are additional info we could provide.

Also we wanted to propose you to participate to the paper we are willing to issue together with the wikidata (and eventually naturalproducts.net hosting). We circulated a google doc today to the coauthors. Here is the link ()
We would be really happy to have you onboard for this paper. If you are OK and willing to contribute please just add your names and institution to the authors list. I will forward you the mail we previously send to other coauthors so you have some details on the editing.

Have an excellent week-end,


PM
