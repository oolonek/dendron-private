* on itness (_inmo_)
* to stand off the ground, you have to use the ground

* that comes from it, that's not you, you don't own that (ideas, illuminations, whatever)
* even Buddha can't understand it. But why worry, you are already it.
* to stand off the ground, you have to use the sky (what you don't know)
* when you have tried everything you know, there is still everything that you don't know. Let room for this to happen.
* form is emptiness, emptiness is form. form ~ emptiness
* doubt and faith you should have in equal measure
* in chinese emptiness could also be space thats less scary
