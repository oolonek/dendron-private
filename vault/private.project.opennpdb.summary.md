### Abstract 

Recent bioinformatic developments are deeply reshaping natural products research. Number of these software, notably the ones aiming to identify chemical structures within mixtures originating from living organisms, could benefit from the access to an open database of structure-organism pairs. However, current databases compiling such information suffer from different disadvantages: commercial access only, scope limited to specific biological taxa and, more generally, poorly standardized fields. Furthermore, in order to ensure the data quality, reference to the work describing the structure-organism relation is mandatory. We therefore collected and curated structure-organism pairs from all accessible natural products databases. Our work led to XXXâ€™XXX curated and referenced structure-organism pairs. Scripts used for the collection, curation and dissemination of the data are fully available. In order to avoid repeating the mistakes made during the elaboration of previously existing natural products databases, we have chosen to host the extracted information on Wikidata. The diffusion of these referenced structure-organism pairs on the Wikidata framework is expected to address the limitations of the currently available databases and we foresee that it will represent the first step towards a yet to establish complete natural products ontology.
