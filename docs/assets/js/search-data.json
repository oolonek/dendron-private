If we apply this \"working with the garage door open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor I understand it as respecting the core concepts of open-science.\n\nWhat is interesting is that in a garage you can peek in and get a sense of the tools, the dirt and a bunch of unrelated stuff and the object crafted in the workshop (furnitures, cars, computers, bombs, strange chemicals). You can see these objects in their final form but most of the time you will see them in their unfinished forms. The fact that people passing by are able to peek at the garage in the very early stages of the projects are of much interest and maybe still not very much adopted in science. I would like to experiment on this concept also. This second note of Andy explains this Anti-marketing concept nicely as https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS\n\n\n\nhttps://michaelnielsen.org/\nhttps://quantum.country/qcvc cf [[vault/tools.mnemonics]]\n\n# Principles\n\n> \n> _Make the first draft deliberately bad.\n> _\n> _It’s hard to write something good from nothing.

The pioritization process led to the selection of a fungal species, Cryptoporus volvatus, which was suspected to contains structural novelty. The authors did not work on the Cryptoporus volvatus culture extract but on the fruiting body extract which appeared richer and isolated trimeric cryptoporic acid derivatives. This works perfectly illustrate the interest of modern spectral based techniques to prioritize and explore collections of natural products extracts libraries. It will clearly be of interest for JNP readers. Scripts and data are correctly (except NMR) shared.\n\nThe approach is interesting however it is ambiguous to call it Species Prioritization Based on Scaffold Uniqueness. It would be more correct to call it Species Prioritization Based on Spectral Dissimilarity. This implies some notable differences, indeed it is very complicated to establish Scaffold Uniqueness prior to any annotation process. Actually the CSCS metric is also incorrectly named a chemical structural and compositional similarity (CSCS) metric since it doesn't takes into account chemical structure within it's calculation. Such clarifications should thus be made early in the tools adoption process, otherwise these incorrect designations are propagated and reused within the users community. I would thus recommend to make these clarification in the title and throughout the manuscript.\n\nOther comments in the annotated pdf file.\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/16a4ab3e-82e9-48e7-801c-6b0781f8424c.html","relUrl":"notes/16a4ab3e-82e9-48e7-801c-6b0781f8424c.html"},{"doc":"Projects","title":"Projects","hpath":"private.projects","content":"\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/384c47f2-3da2-4739-8a64-c37e67d27daf.html","relUrl":"notes/384c47f2-3da2-4739-8a64-c37e67d27daf.html"},{"doc":"Rsi","title":"Rsi","hpath":"private.projects.rsi","content":"\n# RSI Foundation \n\nResilience, Sustainability and Innovation Foundation.

I see your work like going \"a step further\" than doing open-science by just let's say, having a paper or two in Frontiers ... And this is a direction I would like to follow.\n\nStarting part time in April and full time in August this year, I am taking a new position at university of Fribourg in the department of Biology where I will head the metabolomics platform (everything to rebuild there but not from scratch) at 50% of my time and have 50% for my own research and in between fit some additional % for teaching. I am very happy, because it will give me the freedom in research I have been looking forward to from some time now, and it overall a good \"change of air\" after 7 years in Geneva.\n\nI am willing to follow the directions you guys point regarding open-science.\nI have been setting up a small git and associated gitpage gathering published dendron notes (a notetaking tool) over here https://oolonek.github.io/dendron/ (you will find dendron info and a bunch of unrelated stuff there fro now ...)\nI guess that what I would like to set up is as a kind of open electronic lab-book, but also a place to throw in some thoughts and ideas even if not well detailed and very preliminary. Also if they are not directly linked to the topics of my research. I would be curious to see if there would be some feedback from like-minded researchers, or collaborators interested in one or the others of the developed ideas. The point being to \"work with the garage door opened\" https://oolonek.github.io/dendron/notes/88ed503e-7fea-4a52-aead-a4a5d31a9b8e.html. So not only to disseminate the research outputs in an open manner but also, to disseminate them early and not necessarily in their final polished form.\nI would like to experiment on this for one/some of the research projects I will start at Uni Fribourg. \nI fully understand that some collaborators might be reluctant to diffuse their research results in unfinished form so I guess that at the metabolomics platform I wont be able to do this for all project but I would like at least to propose this possibility to my collaborators and hope that some of them will be OK with it.\nElse I'll do it for the project that I lead or were I work alone.\n\nI have various questions in mind that I would like to discuss with you.\n\n- First have your feedback on the feasibility and interest of such approach in the frame of an analytical platform and in general.\n- What would be the best adapted licenses to diffuse this material (is it very important ? can we have various licences ?)\n- What arguments would you suggest to convince academic collaborators ?\n- It is also possible that I have client from the industry at the platform. My feeling is that it's OK to work and take money from the private sector but that this should be somehow published. We have received x $ from z project which had for objective to study effects of a on b. So maybe not all details but at least publish this info. What do you think about this ? I have no clue about how the University of Fribourg and the potential industry clients would take this ?\n- I am also very interested in orienting my research towards more concrete impacts and values that I personally feel as necessary to follow. Here I mean, at our tiny small scale, reorienting our system in better directions, or changing the parts and bits of the system in the other cases ... I am specifically interest in biodiversity conservation. Because 1. I feel it's an urgent matter. 2. I feel some of my research could help on this problematic (however it is clearly not enough to characterize biodiv to save it ... so i will need to find complementary and like-minded fellows here) I understand you share this will of carrying a societal oriented research. I would like to exchange with you on this also. Have your feedback.\n\nI guess other questions will come during the discussion if we can chat.\n\nWould you be interested in exchanging on these topics ?\nIf you are we could try to find a slot next week ? It is pretty free on my side for now.\n\n\nHave a nice day,\n\nPierre-Marie \n\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/442f984f-d193-40fb-a8bf-0ca135de9a5f.html","relUrl":"notes/442f984f-d193-40fb-a8bf-0ca135de9a5f.html"},{"doc":"Project","title":"Project","hpath":"private.project","content":"\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/1d6dc9f6-b039-4a1c-8c3a-bf9ef3883559.html","relUrl":"notes/1d6dc9f6-b039-4a1c-8c3a-bf9ef3883559.html"},{"doc":"Opennpdb","title":"Opennpdb","hpath":"private.project.opennpdb","content":"\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/d4cc9d30-25f7-4c64-8663-b7cf2e431c56.html","relUrl":"notes/d4cc9d30-25f7-4c64-8663-b7cf2e431c56.html"},{"doc":"Wd","title":"Wd","hpath":"private.project.opennpdb.wd","content":"\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/d6712457-ac33-46b4-a655-634db1782f07.html","relUrl":"notes/d6712457-ac33-46b4-a655-634db1782f07.html"},{"doc":"readlist","title":"readlist","hpath":"private.project.opennpdb.wd.todo","content":"\n\n\n- [ ] read Scholia Paper @DUE 2020-09-23 \n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/7294c9d6-89f6-427b-8261-579993ed60c7.html","relUrl":"notes/7294c9d6-89f6-427b-8261-579993ed60c7.html"},{"doc":"Sparql","title":"Sparql","hpath":"private.project.opennpdb.wd.sparql","content":"\n## SPAQRL Query examples\n\n``` sql\nSELECT \n\n?classes\n?itemLabel \n?inchi \n?inchikey \n?cas \n?chebi \n?chembl \n?pubchem \n?taxon \n?taxonLabel \n?parentTaxon \n?parentTaxonLabel \n?parentTaxon2\n?parentTaxon2Label \n\nWHERE {\n  VALUES ?classes {\n    wd:Q11173 # chemical compound\n  }\n  ?item wdt:P31 ?classes ; # instance of\n            wdt:P234 ?inchi ;\n            wdt:P235 ?inchikey ;\n            wdt:P231 ?cas ;\n            wdt:P683 ?chebi ;\n            wdt:P592 ?chembl ;\n            wdt:P662 ?pubchem.\n  \n  ?taxon wdt:P225 'Arabidopsis thaliana';\n         wdt:P171 ?parentTaxon.\n         \n  ?parentTaxon2 wdt:P171 ?parentTaxon.\n  \n  {\n    ?item p:P1582 ?stmt. # natural product of taxon\n    ?stmt ps:P1582 ?taxon. # natural product of taxon\n    OPTIONAL {\n      ?stmt prov:wasDerivedFrom ?ref. \n      ?ref pr:P248 ?art. # stated in\n    }\n  }\n  UNION\n  {\n    ?item p:P703 ?stmt. # found in taxon\n    ?stmt ps:P703 ?taxon. # found in taxon\n    OPTIONAL {\n      ?stmt prov:wasDerivedFrom ?ref.\n      ?ref pr:P248 ?art. # stated in\n    }\n  }\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }\n}\n```\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/28099698-432a-4a13-a829-622e50fe5747.html","relUrl":"notes/28099698-432a-4a13-a829-622e50fe5747.html"},{"doc":"Topics","title":"Topics","hpath":"private.project.opennpdb.topics","content":"\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/d2010056-e656-4671-9d0e-05efffcaee83.html","relUrl":"notes/d2010056-e656-4671-9d0e-05efffcaee83.html"},{"doc":"Summary","title":"Summary","hpath":"private.project.opennpdb.summary","content":"\n\n### Abstract \n\nRecent bioinformatic developments are deeply reshaping natural products research. Number of these software, notably the ones aiming to identify chemical structures within mixtures originating from living organisms, could benefit from the access to an open database of structure-organism pairs. However, current databases compiling such information suffer from different disadvantages: commercial access only, scope limited to specific biological taxa and, more generally, poorly standardized fields. Furthermore, in order to ensure the data quality, reference to the work describing the structure-organism relation is mandatory. We therefore collected and curated structure-organism pairs from all accessible natural products databases. Our work led to XXX’XXX curated and referenced structure-organism pairs. Scripts used for the collection, curation and dissemination of the data are fully available. In order to avoid repeating the mistakes made during the elaboration of previously existing natural products databases, we have chosen to host the extracted information on Wikidata. The diffusion of these referenced structure-organism pairs on the Wikidata framework is expected to address the limitations of the currently available databases and we foresee that it will represent the first step towards a yet to establish complete natural products ontology. \n\n\n[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuldixDzyHxYfTb2ExKZeqXAJw442dlbWVJNGGVZCX8/edit?ts=5f68b664#]]\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/a50a1daf-8f9a-40df-900a-6594fb267e61.html","relUrl":"notes/a50a1daf-8f9a-40df-900a-6594fb267e61.html"},{"doc":"Manuscript","title":"Manuscript","hpath":"private.project.opennpdb.manuscripts","content":"\n\n- [x] contact Steinbeck\n- [x] contact DB owners\n  - [x] draft mail for DB owners [[draft_db_owners_mail]]\n\n\n# A Novel Machine Learning Approach for Natural Products Chemistry\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Context \n\nA large amount of high-quality data around the NP object is available.\n\n### Needs\n\nWays to interpret such highly dimensional and intricate data\n\n### Task\n\nDevelop innovative ML approach to tackle and understand this complexity\n\n### Object\n\n\n\n### Findings\n\n### Conclusion\n\n### Prespective\n\n\n## Snippet usage\n\n# Title\n\n## Context (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nFirst, provide some context to orient those readers who are less familiar with your topic and to establish the importance of your work.\n## Need (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nSecond, state the need for your work, as an opposition between what the scientific community currently has and what it wants.\n## Task (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nThird, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).\n## Object (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nFinally, preview the remainder of the paper to mentally prepare readers for its structure, in the object of the document.\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/1b8e2ac3-7afb-4654-83d4-7d3c9751f146.html","relUrl":"notes/1b8e2ac3-7afb-4654-83d4-7d3c9751f146.html"},{"doc":"Mail","title":"Mail","hpath":"private.project.opennpdb.manuscripts.mail","content":"\n### First round for the gdocs\n\nDear all,\n\nAs discussed we wanted to start circulating the manuscript among the coauthors at this point.\nHere is the google docs link (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuldixDzyHxYfTb2ExKZeqXAJw442dlbWVJNGGVZCX8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe aimed paper is Scientific Data (https://www.nature.com/sdata/publish/for-authors#aims-scope) and we have a target word count of 3000 (without Method section and references). Please keep this in mind when writing your sections. We have been mentioning some of you at appropriate sections, however feel free to contribute where you think it is necessary.\n\nWe notably would need Egon, Daniel, Rod and Ralph's input on everything which is in general Wikidata related. And maybe more specific comments and addition on the chemistry related aspects (Egon) and taxonomy discussion (Rod).\nJames, Guido and Jo's inputs would be needed on the NAPRALERT description and it could maybe be of interest to have some historical facts about this DB creation and it's evolution. We will need Jo's input in the data dissemination section, in specific Methods sections, and also some words regarding the position of the published and wd hosted data in a wider and more long term PHO perspective.\n\nThis project is not completed yet and we still do not have those 200000+ documented pairs on WD. So we also expect that by exchanging around the manuscript, we can see more clearly the important point that we need to address to have an efficient and working bot.\n\nAll native english speakers (and also non native but more talented then we are) please feel free to correct any grammatical errors or poor formulations.\n\n**Important:** please use the \"Suggesting mode\" on the upper left corner when proceeding to edits. Don't worry if the document starts to become cluttered and colorful, we will integrate step by step.\n\nDaniel, we have not received an answer from your part regarding your participation to the manuscript, so we didn't take the liberty to add you to the authors list.

epidemic diseases can be considerably accelerated by easy access to transport. This phenomenon is not new and the risks engaged by the \"modern world\"'s habits have been largely pointed out by the scientific community \\cite{Blamont}. In the context of the pandemia that we are experiencing, an editorial in Nature Plants suggests that a better understanding of plants could slow down epidemic diseases among many other benefits of the use of plants \\cite{natureplants}. \nThis exploratory work might be relevant for this purpose. Part of a drug discovery effort, this project aims to harness the chemo-diversity of a large collection of natural products by finding a standard computer method capable to exploit mass spectrometry data. Recently, it has been shown that Restrictive Boltzmann Machine (RBM) can be trained to learn complex high-dimensional data for statistical analysis of protein sequences \\cite{Tubiana2018}. Grounded to the statistical physics framework, this machine learning algorithm presents the advantage of having a good trade-off efficiency and interpretability. As any data science project, the main challenge remains on the preparation of the data to be usable by machine learning algorithms such as RBMs, we present in this report the many elements that need to be considered in order to be able to successfully use our neural network. The goals of our statistical analysis are  \\textit{organizing spectral data} (as spectral networks for example) \\cite{Wang_2016} \\textit{annotating spectral data} (for example by linking a structure to a spectra)\\cite{Allard2016} and \\textit{visualizing relationships between} metabolites (and group of metabolites) and plants.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Plantextract.jpg}\n  \n  \\label{fig:rbm}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction and motivations}\nSince ancient times, plants have been central for humans all around the world. Natural products have been used for many purposes but one of the most important use has been related to healthcare and the cure of diseases. Medicinal plants are at the core of the history of medicine. The use, combination, and mastery of plants have been experienced by every civilization. Veda texts from Indian civilization date from the second millenary BC, the Ebers Papyrus from the XVI century BC, those text are relevant testimonials of the high interest of plants and their benefits. \nTraditional medicines are based on the results of holistic experimentation but modern medicine has mainly taken the reductionist paradigm for the last 200 years when it comes to the therapeutical object. Indeed, studying natural products for the research of therapeutic bioactivity consisted of studying complex natural extracts and characterizing the main active ingredients of plants or any other natural product. This method, known as Bioactivity-guided fractionation (BGF) has contributed to the synthesis of half of the modern pharmacopeia, however this technique deny the chemical complexity of NP extract in terms of interaction and quantity of metabolites \\cite{allard_pharmacognosy}  . To name but one example, the acetylsalicylic acid, also know as aspirin has been synthesized from salicylate that is found in natural products such as the Willow tree. Interestingly, salicylate has been mention as an active ingredient in ancient Sumer clay tablets and Hippocrates mentions it as an efficient compound to reduce fever. Salicylate is an active metabolite part of specific metabolites, small molecules produced by plants, fungi, or bacterias. In one plant extract only, one could find hundreds up to thousands of metabolites, the presence of such a chemo-diversity make plants complex systems.\nThe motivation for this work lies in the will to study the plant as a complex system instead to focus only on the main active ingredient as it is mainly done in pharmacology. Recent advances in computer science and our ability to process large amounts of data may be opportunities to explore the hollistic paradigm found in traditional medicine. \nIn light of the health crisis we are experiencing, a well-known plant has once again attracted the attention of researchers. Indeed, artemisia, a plant used in Chinese pharmacopoeia for several millennia, is known for its anti-malarial activity thanks to one of its active ingredients, artemisin. This plant also seems to have beneficial effects in reducing the viral presence of Covid-19 in affected patients. However, a group of researchers from Free University of Berlin and the Max Planck institute of Colloids and Interfaces  found that pure artemisin did not show much antiviral activity ,instead it is the collection of active small molecules of artemisia that provide better antiviral results against Covid-19, in other words, the whole plant was able to obtain better results against the new coronavirus than its isolated main active ingredient, artemisin \\cite{artemisia}. Perhaps this example illustrates the interest of studying natural products as complex systems. Given the amount of data involved in this work, the tools of statistical physics seem relevant to address this issue. \n\\vfill\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{chemicalspace.png}\n  \\caption{Schematic view of the gap between molecular space and reference libraries : The metabolomics community has historically fallen short to annotate new small molecules because of the limited size of Chemical reference libraries to match with the spectrums provided by experimental data. Typically, those libraries con.   }\n  \n  \\label{fig:virt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section*{The chemical space}\n\nEnumeration of the chemical space has been an active topic especially with the rise of computer capacity. In the last section, we define specific metabolites as small molecules responsible for the defense of plants, some of those molecules present bioactive interest as discussed and the topic of this project relies on finding new strategies to characterize, identify and annotate metabolites present in NP extracts. \nThe known chemical space gathered in public databases and corporate libraries represents approximately 100 million molecules \\cite{chemicalspace}. \nDespite this impressive number, we are lacking information about the structure and the properties of most molecules. \nChemical reference libraries ( e.g mass spectra, collision cross-section) represent \\textless1\\% of known molecules. \nThis situation could be compared with space observation at Galileo’s times, back 400 years ago: It was possible to have an estimation of the number of stars observable without having them precisely characterized. \nTechniques such as high-resolution fragmentation mass spectrometry have made possible the detection of small molecules ( m/z, intensity, retention time) in complex samples leading to the enumeration of the known chemical space. However, identifying those molecules requires the comparison of the experimental data to corresponding reference values in the libraries to match a molecule. Giving the gap between the known chemical space and chemical reference libraries, it is elusive to imagine identifying small molecules only by comparison of the spectrum and reference dataset, this issue is a well-known limitation in the metabolomics community. Our goal is to find a machine learning strategy that could help annotating unknown metabolites directly from experimental data in an unambiguous manner. Several efforts have started to emerge in the metabolomic community to use machine learning methods \\cite{darkchem}\\cite{Canopus}. We would like to explore the possibilities to use RBMs because of there specificities compared to other types of Neural Networks (NN), the characteristics of our NN will be presented in the Method section.\n\n\n\n\\vfill\n\n\n\n\\section*{Metabolomic}\nThe Increase of metabolite data obtained by mass spectrometry of plant extracts open unprecedented possibilities to harness the chemo-diversity of large collection of natural product (NP) extracts. Specific metabolite are small molecules produced by bacteria, fungi or plants, those organic compounds are not involved in the growth of an organism like primary metabolites but they play a key role in inter-species defenses.\nHumans have been using them as therapeutics, flavourings or pigments for millenaries.    \nIn this work, we would like to improve the capacity of the metabolomic community to identify and annotate specific metabolite. Our topic, that one could include into a meta-discipline devoted to natural biomedical activity of NP aims to take advantage of the possibilites that machine learning brings to annotate spectral data and link it with chemical structures.   \nThis apparent complexity is not surprising considering that one could find hundreds up to thousands of metabolites in one plant extract only : Studying plant at the molecular level is studying a complex system.\n\n The quantity of data coming from mass spectrometry is massive but not yet exploited at it's full potential. This issue is due to the difficulty of annotation of small molecules regarding that chemical references libraries represent barely 1\\% of known molecules which limit the possibilities of identification of new compounds coming from experimental data. \n Historically such holistic approach has been overlooked as the main paradigm has been the reductionist approach for 200 years.\n However, associating the activity of a plant to a single molecule deny the complex interactions of thousands of small molecules that can be found in one extract\\cite{allard_pharmacognosy}. The use of computational tools and statistical physics framework could be beneficial to tackle such complex matrices.\n Entering to the high-dimensional world, it might be possible to use statistical analyses to address those questions. \n \n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{plant meta.png}\n  \\caption{Specific metabolites play a key role for inter-species defenses : they have been used extensively by human beings for thousands of years, to name a few of the most famous ones : Caffeine, Taxol, Artemisin, Morphine, Codeine, Revsveratrol, Cocaine, Quinine, Nicotine...}\n  \\label{fig:virt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section*{Machine Learning Problematic}\n\nMachine learning approaches in drug discovery are usually run on set of structures \\cite{Stokes2020,Tubiana2018}. The training set being in these cases constituted by pairs of structures and bioactivity.\nThis is perfectly valid and adapted to mine chemical libraries. However the big difference in our case is that we don't have pure chemicals but mixture of thousands to ten of thousands of metabolite per extracts. The second problem is that the annotation step (linking a spectra with a molecule) is a complicated one and that confidence in the annotation is hard to evaluate.\nIt might thus be interesting to directly exploit spectra, which can be taken as direct structures reflection. Exploiting spectra means relying in experimental data only and also means Independence regarding the metabolite annotation stage. \\textit{Exploration of directly the links between spectra ensembles and sought-after bioactivity could thus be an interesting option.}\n\nAnother interesting field to investigate would be to establish a computational framework for the implementation of a virtuous cycle of metabolite annotation, such as we previously proposed. \\cite{Allard2017a} Here machine learning could be used at the in silico fragmentation stage, trained on pairs of spectra and structure. Machine learning could also be used at the in silico fragmentation stage, notably to infer biosynthetic reaction rules from set of closely related chemicals.\n\nInteresting approaches allowing to predict substructures and associate them to fragmentation spectra have been devised recently and could be implemented and improved. \\cite{Rogers2019}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Fig_2_rev.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\copyright \\textbf{Allard2016} A strategy to generate plausible structures from in-silico databases and annotates new metabolites from experimental data thanks to the extension of the in-silico library. }\n  \n  \\label{fig:virt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section*{Data set}\n\nWe have several data-sets gathering various type of information corresponding to 1600 plant extracts.\n\\begin{itemize}\n   \n \\item The mass spectrometric data MS1 is a flat file (csv) of 64001 rows and 1600 columns (the plant extracts that we will call samples hereafter). This dataset has three dimensions, mass over charge ratio (m/z) at retention time(RT) on the rows, our features, and the intensity of a feature for each sample. \n Each feature has an associated fragmentation mass spectra, the purpose of the fragmentation mass spectra is to characterize more specifically the molecule in order to give to each molecule a \"fingerprint\" of its structure. \n \\item Those informations are gathered in a second dataset, mass spectrometric data MS2 which is a flat file (.mgf) constituted of 64001 blocks. Each block has a header containing parent ion mass, retention time and features identity corresponding to the 64001 rows of our first dataset. \n \\item The third dataset correspond to metadata files for the 1600 samples gathered as a flat file (.csv) and indicating metadata such as botanical characteristic(species,genus,families) and bioactivities against a specific target.\n \\item The fourth dataset gather the metadata of the 64001 features on a flat file (.csv) by giving the chemical structures and chemical classes of each feature.\n \\item Finally there is a molecular network dataset made by the computation of a pairwise cosine between each spectral features of the second dataset.\n \\end{itemize}\n \n  \\begin{figure}{h}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Tubiana.png}\n  \\caption{\\copyright \\textbf{Tubiana2019} Modeling of proteins with RBM : The data used on the visible layer of the network where protein sequences shaped with the Multiple-Sequence Alignment tool,as they are strings, NLP tools were usable to evaluate the occurancy of amino acids in the sequences provided. We need to find a method to encode our spectrums to put them as our input in RBMs. }\n  \n  \\label{fig:rbm}\n\\end{figure}\n \n \\subsection{Discussion}\n \n The datasets we have are not usable in their current state. In order to be able to exploit data, the first step of a machine learning project is called data mining or features engineering. This step consists in preparing the data to be exploitable by the different machine learning techniques. In our case, we are in possession of spectral data consisting of a list of triplets: \\textbf{m/z}, \\textbf{retention time} and \\textbf{intensity}. \nBy discretizing the spectrum into several intervals, this representation resembles a model from the natural language processing (NLP): \\textit{Bag of Words}. The first two indices could correspond to a word and the intensity to the number of times the word appears in the text. \nLater, we could transform the \\textit{Bag of Words}  representation by \\textit{One hot encoding}: We replace the list by a matrix such as $M_{kl} = \\sum_i \\delta_{k_i, k} \\delta_{l_i, l} I_i$\nFinally, we transform this matrix into a vector, we iterate the procedure for each spectrum and the alignment of the vectors obtained gives a matrix usable with the same type of pipeline as in word processing. \nSeveral approaches grounded to NLP have been tackled to annotate mass spectrums of metabolites and seems to give interesting results compare to standard techniques to evaluate spectrums, known as similarity measures such as \\textit{cosine score}, thoses techniques have good results for identical spectrums but underperform for complex samples \\cite{spec2vec}\\cite{Mass2motifs}. Nevertheless,we are still lacking of a clear vision on what technique to use. Techniques from NLP seems promising but the  question remaining is what to do whith the output resulting of this kind of method. At the end of the day, we would like to get insights of molecular structures from raw spectra data. This means that we want to move from the space of spectra to the space of structures. We, therefore, need to take into account the different granularity involved in our project to keep close the big picture of our motivations.\n\n\\subsubsection{Granularity}\n\nBearing in mind that one of our objectives is to extract information related to the bioactivities of non-annotated metabolites directly from experimental data, the notion of granularity needs to be addressed. We have just presented the first space, that of the spectra, this space is the lowest level space to make an analogy with computer science, it is the space that contains the raw information on the fingerprint and therefore the existence of a certain quantity of metabolites per spectrum. As we have seen, we first try to link these spectra to molecular structures. We are therefore looking for a technique to be able to move from the space of spectrums to the space of structures. Later, the objective would be to move from the space of structures to the space of bio-activities and this step could even be divided by including the space of taxonomies in order to refine our method.\nIn doing so, it appears that the molecular object holds a central place in the framework of our problem. In order to be able to perform our statistical analysis, we need to be able to manipulate an object suitable for machine learning techniques. \n\n\\subsection{The molecular object}\n\nOur postulate comes from the fact that machine learning can be used to leverage the identification  of new molecules with interesting bioactivity for humans as it is more and more done \\cite{Antibiotic}. Classical methods that consist in searching for a molecule in a library suffer from the size of reference libraries as we have seen: If an unknown molecule is detected and is not present in any of the libraries, the search will not yield anything.\nIn doing so, starting from the space of the spectrums, we should be able to use a molecular representation that would allow the use of our algorithms.\nThere are several techniques that encode the structure of a molecule however it appears that SMILES strings represent the state of the art for encoding a molecular representation. \nSMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification) are sequences of characters. This text format allows the use of NLP tools\\cite{hernandez}. This approach seems to be the most interesting, especially since it allows us to continue the analogy with the method we have mentioned, which uses character sequences to encode the structure of proteins.\nIn addition, it would allow the use of data from large libraries of molecules such as \\textbf{PubChem}  or \\textbf{HMDB} that provide a SMILES version of their molecules. Despite of the interest of this representation, many different SMILES strings can represent the same molecule, there is a lack of invariance to atom ordering. This limitation needs to be overcome to be able to use this representation in an unambiguous manner.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{subfigure}{.35\\linewidth}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{spaces.png}\n    \\caption{.}\n    \\label{fig:data}\n  \\end{subfigure}\n  \\begin{subfigure}{.35\\linewidth}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{rbmspace.png}\n    \\caption{ }\n    \\label{fig:rotdata}\n  \\end{subfigure}\n  \\begin{subfigure}{.35\\linewidth}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{SMILES.png}\n    \\caption{ }\n    \\label{fig:rotdata}\n  \\end{subfigure}\n  \n\\caption{To identify and characterise new molecules we need to pass through different spaces.

The function $\\hat{Y}$ is calculated to perform a prediction of the function Y and to measure the score of our model, we can track its performance with a cost function, the idea of such functions is simply to measure the difference between the predicted value and the actual value. \nThe Mean Squarer Error (MSE) is one of the most common cost functions, it is widely  use in Linear Regression : \n\\( \\mathrm{MSE}=\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\left\\|\\hat{y}^{(i)}-y^{(i)}\\right\\|^{2} \\)\n\nOur goal is to get a score for our MSE function as close as possible to zero (Meaning having the minimum distance between the two functions). Achieving that would mean that our model fit well our data and is able to perform a good prediction. \n\nThose elements are general aspects that we find in every machine learning models. The idea is to give a first flavour of the domain, for further details about machine learning theory, \\textit{The Elements of Statistical Learning} is a very complete reference. In the next section we will focus on the theory of the model we would like to implement for our problematic. \n\n\\newpage\n\n\n \\subsection*{RBM and Energy Based Model}\n \n  Recently, it has been shown that RBM are particularly efficient to learn complex high-dimensional data \\cite{Tubiana2018}. In this work, we would like to adapt this method in order to infer spectral features which could be signatures of sought-after bioactive metabolites. RBM constitute a versatile tool that could help to organize spectral data and prioritize them. \n \n In the dense landscape of machine learning,  RBM are energy-based models (EBM) with generative properties.They can be used in the framework of Deep Learning and have been performing well for tasks such as denoising, recommendation systems and artificial data generation \\cite{hinton}. \n The main idea of EBM is to represent our configuration of data and features as one energy function. The model learn by minimizing this energy function as we will see and the goal is to get a configuration with the shortest distance between the energy function and the distribution of our data. Similarly as the MSE that we presented in the last section, having a low value of E means that our model has been able to fit well complex data in high-dimensional spaces, the interest of using such energy functions is to be able to use the tools of statistical physics : The interest of this approach is related to the (very) high-dimension spaces that we are reaching giving the data we would like to manipulate. Deep Learning and Neural Networks algorithms are still lacking of a robust theory explaining the behaviour of the models because of the high-dimension of these networks. \n We will see next, that RBM can be seen as a specific kind of spin glass which brought us back to a well-known statistical physicis model : Ising model.\n \n \\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Energy.png}\n  \\caption{The Energy function is updated to learn complex data in high-dimensional spaces. As for MSE, the distance between the two curves is an indicator of the performance of the model.}\n  \\label{fig:rbm}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\section{Theory}\n\\subsection{From Ising model to Hopfield Network}\n\nIsing model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical physics. By simple assumptions of interactions between neighbour fixed spins, the model allows identification of phase transition in second dimension.\nThe spins are arranged in a lattice and discrete variables that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins. The Hamiltoninan of the system can be defined as follow : \n\n\\begin{equation}\nH(\\textbf{s}) = - J\\sum_{i,j} s_i s_j - h\\sum_i  s_i   \n\\label{eq:ef}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWith \\(s_{ij}\\) the spins, \\(J\\) the interaction spin-spin and \\(h\\) the magnetic field.\n\\bigskip\n\nThe theoretical frame of energy based-model of Neural Networks (NN) is coming from Ising Model, often referred as Inverse Ising problems : we are interested to learn the \\textit{couplings} between spins in order to generate a specific configuration at equilibrium \\cite{tramel}.\n\nThanks to the work of Hopfield \\cite{hopfield}, it has been possible to shape a model mimicking the collective properties of neurons. In this model, the neurons produce memory capable of content-addressable. They are interconnected, creating a network that follow this assertion  : \"The ability of large collections of neurons to perform computational task may in part be a spontaneous collective consequence of having a large number of interacting simple neurons.\"\nThis last quote make possible the analogy with Ising, we are no longer evaluating spins but neurons and after a redefinition of the parameters, we have at disposal all the tools developed by statistical physics and specifically spin glasses theory.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Hopfield.png}\n  \\caption{A Hopfield Network \\cite{figure1} : A fully connected network where each spin represent a neuron associated with two possible states (-1,1) like the Ising Model}\n  \\label{fig:rbm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe consider that each Neurons has two states, communicating or not. The interaction between neurons can be illustrated by a strength of connection T where the value 0 means that the neurons are not connected and 1 they are fully connected. This is our learning rule respecting the Hebbian statement (Neuron that fire together, wire together):\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{array}{l}{V_{i} \\rightarrow 1} \\\\ {V_{i} \\rightarrow 0}\\end{array} \\text { if } \\sum_{j \\neq i} T_{i j} V_{j} \\begin{array}{l}{>U_{i}} \\\\ {<U_{i}}\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe energy function of a Hopfield network can be defined as : \n\n\\begin{equation}\nE = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i\\sum_j w_{ij} V_i V_j  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\(W_{ij}\\) is the weight matrix describing all the connections of the system.\\(V_{ij}\\) are vectors that includes all the states of the spins/neurons (-1 or 1).As we can see the formulation is similar to the hamiltonian of the Ising Model described above and with the help of the partition function, it has brought the possibility to identify phase transitions according to tempature. This model has contribute to determinate the average magnetization of a system in a theoretical perspective but experimental results in condensed matter have validated the interest of such a model. In the machine learning perspective, those tools bring the possibility to identify learning phase transitions and the monitoring of the parameters (temperature, size of the network) highlight the existence of an optimum learning phase called compositional phase in the context of this work \\cite{emergence}. Furthermore, it is an active domain of research that seems to provide theoretical insights for NN.\n\n\n We will focus here on RBM that is  a close model to Hopfield network. Nevertheless, we might have now in mind a little bit of intuition regarding the process involved here and despite some differences, RBM follows similar principles and that we might summarize as :\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item The neurons are equivalent to spins and the synapses can be associated to the connection/interaction between the neurons.We, therefore, redefine the terms of our system.\n\n\\item We can define an energy function that is typical in spin glass theory.\n\n\\item We can evaluate this energy function through statistical physics theory by using : Boltzmann distribution and the partition function.\n\n\\item Learning phase transitions can be identify and parameters can be set to evolve in an optimum learning phase.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{subfigure}{.35\\linewidth}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{myRBM.png}\n    \\caption{A Restrictive Boltzmann machine is a biparti graph where the input data is set in the visible layer and the features corresponds to the units of the hidden layer.The matrix \\textbf{W} couples the visible and hidden units.}\n    \\label{fig:data}\n  \\end{subfigure}\n  \\begin{subfigure}{.35\\linewidth}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Logli.png}\n    \\caption{Gradient ascent consist of reaching the global maximum of the data distribution, this is the way the algorithm learn. }\n    \\label{fig:rotdata}\n  \\end{subfigure}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Restricted Boltzmann Machine}\n\nA RBM is an energy based model which can be used as  building block of deep network in the context of unsupervised learning. The model is constituted by two layers of spins (playing the role of neurons). One layer is made by visible units \\(v_i\\) where the input data pass through, the second layer is constituted by hidden units corresponding to the latent variables that will make possible the generation of data by the RBM. The \\textit{couplings} and \\textit{local fields} ,which corresponds to the spins of our system, construct an energy function that will be evaluated. The two layers are interconnected but the spins in each layer are independent to each other, this is the specificity of a RBM regarding Hopfield Network and Boltzman Machine (cf: FIG.\\ref{fig:rbm}). Therefore,the system can be defined as follows :\n\n\\begin{equation}\nE(\\textbf{h},\\textbf{v}) = - \\sum_i a_i v_i - \\sum_j b_j h_j - \\sum_{i,j} v_i w_{ij} h_j\n\\label{eq:ef}\n\\end{equation}\n\n \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are \\textit{external fields} acting respectively on the visible and hidden units. The nodes can have different kind of values depending on the nature of the data set, for simplicity in this case, we will consider binary units as \\(h_i,v_i = 0,1\\). The probability of a certain configuration is  given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann  density function (taking \\(\\beta = 1\\)) :\n\n\\begin{equation}\nP(\\textbf{h},\\textbf{v}) = \\frac{e^{-E(\\textbf{h},\\textbf{v})}}{Z}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere \\( \\textstyle Z = \\sum_{\\textbf{h},\\textbf{v}} e^{-E(\\textbf{h},\\textbf{v})}\\) is the \\textit{partition function}. The probabilities of activation for visible and hidden spins can be computed as follows (given the independence of units in the same layer):\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(v_i = 1 | \\textbf{h}) &  = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-a_i - \\sum_{j} w_{ij} h_j}} \\nonumber \\\\\n& = sigm \\left(a_i + \\sum_{j} w_{ij} h_j \\right)\n\\label{eq:act_vis}\n\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(h_j = 1 | \\textbf{v}) & = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-b_j - \\sum_i w_{ij} v_i}} \\nonumber \\\\\n& = sigm \\left(b_j + \\sum_i w_{ij} v_i \\right)\n\\label{eq:act_hid}\n\\end{align}\n\nThe neuron activation take place by choosing binary units \\(h_j,v_i = 0,1\\) in (4) or (5). The external fields \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) adjust the mean of the units while \\(w_{ij}\\), the weight maxtrix couples the visible and hidden layers (with \\textit{sigm} representing the sigmoid function). Several type of activation functions can be used , in the context of our project dRelu function should be investigated.  \n\nThe probability distribution of the visible units is given by the following Boltzmann distribution :\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(\\textbf{v}) &  = \\sum_{\\textbf{h}} P(\\textbf{h},\\textbf{v}) \\nonumber \\\\\n& = \\frac{e^{-E(\\textbf{v})}}{Z}, \\quad Z = \\sum_{\\textbf{v}} e^{-E(\\textbf{v})}\n\\label{eq:p_model}\n\\end{align}\n\nIn order to optimize the RBM for a given data-set , we need to maximize the likelihood of the training data \\(P(\\textbf{v}\\). In other words, we want to estimate the parameters of a distribution of our data-set in order to fit with our statistical model. \nTo perform this, we use the gradient ascent over the log-likelihood (We use \"log-l..\" to compute sums rather than products), \\(\\log P(\\textbf{v})\\) :\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\partial \\log P(\\textbf{v})}{\\partial w_{ij}} = \\langle v_i P(h_j = 1 | \\mathbf{v}) \\rangle_{data} - \\langle v_i h_j \\rangle_{model}\n\\label{eq:opt}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere \\(\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_{data}\\) denotes an average over the distribution of our data-set (\\( \\textstyle P_{data}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\mathbf{v}_n \\in data} \\delta (\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{v}_n ) \\)) and \n\\(\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_{model}\\) represent the average over the distribution \\eqref{eq:p_model}. Introducing the \\textit{learning rate} \\(\\alpha \\) (as a parameter for gradient ascent) we obtain our learning rule for the weights matrix :\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\alpha \\left( \\langle \\mathbf{v h}^T \\rangle_{data} - \\langle \\mathbf{v h}^T \\rangle_{model} \\right)\n\\label{eq:w_up}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAdditionally, we can get the update rules for the external fields\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:a_up}\n\\Delta \\mathbf{a} = \\alpha \\left( \\mathbf{v}_{data} - \\mathbf{v}_{model} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:b_up}\n\\Delta \\mathbf{b} = \\alpha \\left( \\mathbf{h}_{data} - \\mathbf{h}_{model} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n As we said, the training consists of performing a gradient ascent. We want to rich an equilibrium between the mean of our data distribution and the mean of the parameters of the model. Nevertheless, the average over the model \\(\\textstyle \\langle \\cdot \\rangle_{model}\\) implies to compute the partition function \\( \\textstyle Z\\) introduced in (4) which is impossible due to the high-dimension involved and the log-likelihood can't be computed directly, we need to find approximations. Monte Carlo based algorithms are the usual solutions to estimate the likelihood. Some other interesting methods exists based on mean field theory and statistical physics \\cite{emergence}. However, in this work, we choose to use the \\textit{Gibbs Sampling} algorithm.\n \n In order to use RBMs for our project, we need to define a function that will link the visible and hidden layer with the spirit of what was mentioned in the machine learning introduction (we have an input X, we need to define a function to get an output Y with the appropriate characteristics). As we saw the input should be a sequence of strings encoding metabolites and we are still trying to formulate this function. \n \n In the method developed for the protein generation \\cite{Tubiana2018}, this function come as :\n \n \\( I_{\\mu}(\\mathbf{v})=\\sum_{i} w_{i \\mu}\\left(v_{i}\\right) \\)\n \n This function define what the hidden units receive. \\textbf{v} represent the sequence on the visible layers (SMILES in our case) and the computation of the function \\textbf{I} is \"analogous to the score of a sequence with a position-specific weight matrix\".\n Such a score is interesting but the analogy in our case fall short because of the limitations of the SMILES strings. If we are lacking confidence on the capacity of this method to represent molecules in an invariant way, it is difficult to imagine building a function that will track the occurancy of molecules that can be define by different sequences of strings. \n This problem has been our main brake to go further in the advancement of our problem.\n \n \n\n \n \\newpage\n \n \\section{Conclusion}\n\nOur problematic is far to be resolved but many things have been learned and the outcomes of this work kept vivid the enthusiasms of the author. \nWe were able to specify our problem by taking into account the different granularity. It appears, under these conditions, necessary to find a strategy that would allow us to move from one space to another without ambiguity (spectrum, structure, taxonomy, bio-activity). We have seen that the SMILES encoding technique seems to be a relevant approach to encode the molecular representation of metabolites, in addition to being a widely used approach in the field, it allows us to make a link with the work that has been done on protein sequences and their representations \\cite{Tubiana2018}. As SMILES is a suite of strings, we can imagine using the NLP tools to prepare our databases for use on the visible layer of our RBMs.  \nNevertheless, we still have to formulate the equations that will allow us to go from X to Y as we have seen: this implies going beyond the limitations we have mentioned in relation to SMILES.\nOn the other hand, in this report, we have not discussed the contributions of the mean field theory and in particular the so-called replica trick\\cite{mezard}. This method seems however essential to exploit the compositional phase presented here \\cite{emergence}. The author is determined to continue his work in this field, especially since he feels that he is suddenly stopped at the door of one of the deepest questions tackled by statistical physics. It would be interesting to estimate the Z partition function coming from a space as vast as the known molecular space. Moreover, it would also be an opportunity to compare the addition of a spin on our whole system and the influence that it can have on the set of configurations as predicted by mean field approximation\\cite{mackay}.\n\nSometimes in the history of science, we find that ideas travel and become clearer through time. This phenomenon is well known to physicists and perhaps the atomic intuition that we found asleep and already in Lucretia's De Rerum de Natura is a good illustration of this.\nTo be interested in plants, as we have seen, is also to make such a journey and perhaps it is possible to find a way to reconcile thousand-year-old intuitions with the tools available today. This journey into molecular space is all the more exciting and, to all intents and purposes, it perhaps allows us to remember that observation is the basis of all science. \n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\nThis work was done under very particular conditions and great difficulties were encountered.

Sur la route du Seujet, au dessu du lieu dit Les Granges, commune de Bons en Chablais\n\nMes questions:\n\n- il y a un petit ruisseau (ruisseau des Betiers) qui passe le long des parcelles 828 et 867. Est il possible, légalement,  d'y prélever de l'eau ? Savez vous la qualité, potabilité de celle ci ?\n\n- il me semble qu'il y a un captage d'eau de source sur la route du Seujet en allant vers le lieu dits les Granges. Est ce que cela représenterai une possibilité pour un accès a l'eau ?\n\n- il y a des citernes de récupération d'eau de pluie, il faudrait les changer mais ces citernes peuvent elle permettre d'accéder a de l'eau potable (après installation de filtres céramique et ou osmose inverse\n\n\nVoila comme vous l'avez compris mes question peuvent se résumer a \"comment avoir de l'eau\" sur cette parcelle !\n\n\nAu plaisir de vous lire,\nN'hésitez pas a me recontacter par mail ou par téléphone (0650359932) si vous souhaitez des informations complémentaires.\n\nPierre-Marie Allard\n\n\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/c3d835b9-a764-4e65-8bd3-ad8947635f5b.html","relUrl":"notes/c3d835b9-a764-4e65-8bd3-ad8947635f5b.html"},{"doc":"Count_lab_hours","title":"Count_lab_hours","hpath":"private.count_lab_hours","content":"\n\n\n## Saturday 09 January\n\n- `12:00` //_Let's start_\n- `14:09` Unige_mails //_dont label this comment_\n- `16:17` //_Pausa_\n- `16:43` End \n\n\n| Time span          | Task        |\n| -----------------: | ----------- |\n|          `00:30`   | End         |\n|          `02:15`   | Unige_mails |\n|        **`02:30`** | **Total**   |\n\n> _Last update 17:10_ / Lines [valid:3, comments:1, invalid:1]\n| Time span          | Task        |\n| -----------------: | ----------- |\n|          `00:30`   | End         |\n|          `02:15`   | Unige_mails |\n|        **`02:30`** | **Total**   |\n\n> _Last update 17:09_ / Lines [valid:3, comments:1, invalid:1]\n\n\n\n## Saturday 09 January\n\n- `16:49` //_Let's start_\n- `16:49` CodeHard\n- `17:50` ReadHard\n- `18:00` //_Pause\n- `18:35` CodeHard\n- `19:05` Sleep\n\n| Time span          | Task      |\n| -----------------: | --------- |\n|          `00:30`   | CodeHard  |\n|          `01:00`   | ReadHard  |\n|          `00:30`   | Sleep     |\n|        **`02:00`** | **Total** |\n\n> _Last update 16:54_ / Lines [valid:5, comments:1, invalid:1]\n\n\n| Time span          | Task      |\n| -----------------: | --------- |\n|          `00:00`   | CodeHard  |\n|          `01:00`   | ReadHard  |\n|          `01:00`   | Sleep     |\n|        **`02:00`** | **Total** |\n\n> _Last update 16:53_ / Lines [valid:5, comments:1, invalid:1]\n| Time span          | Task      |\n| -----------------: | --------- |\n|          `00:00`   | CodeHard  |\n|          `00:15`   | Pause     |\n|          `01:00`   | ReadHard  |\n|          `01:00`   | Sleep     |\n|        **`02:15`** | **Total** |\n\n> _Last update 16:51_ / Lines [valid:6, comments:0, invalid:1]\n\n| Time span          | Task      |\n| -----------------: | --------- |\n|          `00:00`   | CodeHard  |\n|          `00:15`   | Pause     |\n|          `01:00`   | ReadHard  |\n|          `01:00`   | Sleep     |\n|        **`02:15`** | **Total** |\n\n> _Last update 16:51_ / Lines [valid:6, comments:0, invalid:1]\n\n\n\n## Saturday 09 January\n\n- `07:38` //_Let's start_\n- `08:23` Mail\n- `09:12` Analysis UI Orders\n- `10:30` Meeting Marketing Team\n- `10:42` //_Coffee_\n- `11:45` Meeting Dev Team //_Issue with authentication_\n- `12:30` Mail\n- `13:06` //_Lunch_\n- `16:05` Code new API Orders\n- `16:30` //_pick up kids_\n- `17:43` Code new API Orders\n- `18:14` API Documentation\n\n\n| Time span          | Task                   |\n| -----------------: | ---------------------- |\n|          `00:30`   | API Documentation      |\n|          `00:45`   | Analysis UI Orders     |\n|          `04:15`   | Code new API Orders    |\n|          `01:30`   | Mail                   |\n|          `01:00`   | Meeting Dev Team       |\n|          `01:15`   | Meeting Marketing Team |\n|        **`09:30`** | **Total**              |\n\n> _Last update 17:04_ / Lines [valid:9, comments:3, invalid:1]\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/65629f44-8cb9-439f-be23-fe4ad55886ec.html","relUrl":"notes/65629f44-8cb9-439f-be23-fe4ad55886ec.html"},{"doc":"Contacts","title":"Contacts","hpath":"private.contacts","content":"\nSophie Allard -

ACBS is located between the foothill of the Andes mountains an the Amazon lowlands basin. It is situated between 1090 and 1200 masl on the south banks of the Chontayacu river, an affluent of the Anzu river. The lands are part of the Mera canton, Pastaza province. This biotope is very particular, pluviosity is above 5000 mm / year and a median T° of 21 °C. Extreme endemism and high biodiversity are present on the banks of the cristalline waters of the Chontayacu river, this biodiversity is clearly understudied. The ACBS biological station is working in close collaboration with two local biodiversity conservation associations: Ecominga (https://ecomingafoundation.wordpress.com/) and Sumak Kawsay In Situ (https://www.sumakkawsayinsitu.org/english). In Particular Lou Jost (https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=iY2s8acAAAAJ&hl=en), a mathematical ecologist and population geneticist is leading the Ecominga foundation.

Spectra and molecular structures\n\n## Context (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nTo compare plants via their metabolomes it is necessary to align their individual constituents which are metabolites. These metabolites are classically called \"features\". In LCMS-based metabolomics a feature is typically defined by its retention time (on a given chromatographic column), by its intensity and by its MS spectra at different levels. The MS1 level is the m/z ratio of the intact feature, while the MS2 (or MSMS) corresponds to a m/z ratios of the fragments of a feature. Each of these m/z ratios are associated to an intensity which is not always proportional to the amount of the feature but which is rather defined by the chemical groups of the analyte (ionization response). Additionally a chemical structure can be linked to a feature if a metabolite annotation process is carried. \nSome of the features dimensions obtained in LCMS-based metabolomics are highly analytical platform dependant. \n## Need (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nIn ecometabolomics, it will be necessary to compare large datasets. The size of these dataset will imply long acquisition time within a lab or comparison of dataset acquired across different laboratories.\n\n## Task (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nIt is thus crucial for \"good ecometabolomics practices\" to define the pro and cons of the different features dimensions and select the ones which are pertinent for such large scale, multi-matrix, multi lab comparisons.\n## Object (of the paper/doc/note/paragraph)\nHere we will discuss the importance of the spectral and molecular structure dimensions associated to metabolomics features and propose a rationale for the optimal exploitation in an ecometabolomics perspective.\n\n\n\nTo tackle the problem of features comparison across metabolomics datasets, dropping the retention time and intensity dimensions appear as an interesting option. These two values, which are the first to be considered to plot a chromatogram, suffer from different weaknesses. Retention time, on one side, is extremely dependant on the gradient and the phase chemistry of the chromatographic column. Apart from a broad polarity range, it does not bring much to the feature classification process. Intensity, on the other hand, is dependant the ionization response of the feature. This means that is not alway quantitative and that, for example minute amount of a given alkaloid (an easily ionized class of compounds in positive ionization mode) could have a higher intensity than larger amounts of an unfunctionalized terpene. To complicate things, intensity is dependant on the MS architecture. These two dimensions (retention time and intensity) are tricky to compare within a metabolomics dataset acquired on a given analytical platform. They are virtually impossible to compare across different labs using different LCMS architectures.\nSo we are left with two objects: the spectral data and the molecular structures. These two objects also happen to be very information rich compared to retention time and intensity. We will describe each of them in more details and discuss optimal ways for the exploitation.\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/a150e7ae-9b13-4e69-a596-952829bf9b8f.html","relUrl":"notes/a150e7ae-9b13-4e69-a596-952829bf9b8f.html"},{"doc":"Readlist","title":"Readlist","hpath":"readlist","content":"\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/441df927-fbfb-4b0b-94fa-9d7c946e2bc8.html","relUrl":"notes/441df927-fbfb-4b0b-94fa-9d7c946e2bc8.html"},{"doc":"Web Articles","title":"Web Articles","hpath":"readlist.web-articles","content":"\n# Reflections on 2020 as an independent researcher\n\nhttps://andymatuschak.org/2020/\n\n(reading)\n\n\n# AI in Drug Discovery 2020 - A Highly Opinionated Literature Review \n\nhttps://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2021/01/ai-in-drug-discovery-2020-highly.html?m=1\n\n# 2021-01-14 21:52\n\n![[tools.mnemonics#prompts,1]]\n\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/8cc0efa2-9fec-490f-836e-57786fbf8439.html","relUrl":"notes/8cc0efa2-9fec-490f-836e-57786fbf8439.html"},{"doc":"Socialmamoth","title":"Socialmamoth","hpath":"readlist.socialmamoth","content":"\nTaming the Mammoth: Why You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think\n\nhttps://waitbutwhy.**com**/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/fa4d927f-555a-44ce-8a4a-328ff96a8fe1.html","relUrl":"notes/fa4d927f-555a-44ce-8a4a-328ff96a8fe1.html"},{"doc":"Papers","title":"Papers","hpath":"readlist.papers","content":"\n\n\n2021-01-24 17:04\n\n# Estimate Metabolite Taxonomy and Structure with a FragmentCentered Database and Fragment Network\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03784.pdf\n\n\n\n\n2021-01-17 09:21\n\n# Network-based strategies in metabolomics data analysis and interpretation: from molecular networking to biological interpretation\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14789450.2020.1766975\n\n[[networks]]\n\n\n\n\n2021-01-13 22:12\n\n# Towards a biodiversity knowledge graph\n\nhttps://riojournal.com/articles.php?journal_name=rio&id=8767\nCheck RIO in general\nDig into http://beta.briefideas.org/\n//TODO Make a nanopub and related  note\n\n\n2021-01-12 16:41\n\n# Metabolite networks filtering and explo\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/01/06/2021.01.06.425569.full.pdf\n\n\n2021-01-09 14:18\n\n# Florian Huber blog post msmsmatch tuto\nhttps://blog.esciencecenter.nl/build-your-own-mass-spectrometry-analysis-pipeline-in-python-using-matchms-part-i-d96c718c68ee\n\n\n\n2021-01-09 13:15\n\n# Chemical graph generators\nhttps://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008504\n\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/8a627ba7-8b8e-483a-aaed-5142f455b602.html","relUrl":"notes/8a627ba7-8b8e-483a-aaed-5142f455b602.html"},{"doc":"Marchal","title":"Marchal","hpath":"readlist.marchal","content":"\nBruno Marchal\n\nLe secret de l'amibe conseillé par Jo Bonnemort en 2009\n\nhttp://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications.html\n\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/6205837e-0c4c-4461-a9dd-939fc841e757.html","relUrl":"notes/6205837e-0c4c-4461-a9dd-939fc841e757.html"},{"doc":"Laborit","title":"Laborit","hpath":"readlist.laborit","content":"\n\nEloge de la fuite Henri Laborit\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/0a740fdd-d9df-47a3-a98f-b238c955afb9.html","relUrl":"notes/0a740fdd-d9df-47a3-a98f-b238c955afb9.html"},{"doc":"Bihouix","title":"Bihouix","hpath":"readlist.bihouix","content":"\nLimit to growth - Rapport du club de Rome (preface Vancovicci)\n\nPhilippe Bihouix - l'age des lowtechs\n\nIvan Illitch - Energie et equité\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/7e05f555-4a2c-470e-9665-11fbc9086929.html","relUrl":"notes/7e05f555-4a2c-470e-9665-11fbc9086929.html"},{"doc":"Arutam","title":"Arutam","hpath":"readlist.arutam","content":"(ZK imported)\n\nDans le numéro 57 de Les Grands Dossiers des Sciences Humaines.\n\nPage 71.

As such, they are critical to the evolution of modern science, in which the work of one scientist builds upon that of others. To reach their goal, papers must aim to inform, not impress. They must be highly readable — that is, clear, accurate, and concise. They are more likely to be cited by other scientists if they are helpful rather than cryptic or self-centered.\n\nScientific papers typically have two audiences: first, the referees, who help the journal editor decide whether a paper is suitable for publication; and second, the journal readers themselves, who may be more or less knowledgeable about the topic addressed in the paper. To be accepted by referees and cited by readers, papers must do more than simply present a chronological account of the research work. Rather, they must convince their audience that the research presented is important, valid, and relevant to other scientists in the same field. To this end, they must emphasize both the motivation for the work and the outcome of it, and they must include just enough evidence to establish the validity of this outcome.\n\nPapers that report experimental work are often structured chronologically in five sections: first, Introduction; then Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion (together, these three sections make up the paper's body); and finally, Conclusion.\n\nThe Introduction section clarifies the motivation for the work presented and prepares readers for the structure of the paper.\nThe Materials and Methods section provides sufficient detail for other scientists to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper. In some journals, this information is placed in an appendix, because it is not what most readers want to know first.\nThe Results and Discussion sections present and discuss the research results, respectively. They are often usefully combined into one section, however, because readers can seldom make sense of results alone without accompanying interpretation — they need to be told what the results mean.\nThe Conclusion section presents the outcome of the work by interpreting the findings at a higher level of abstraction than the Discussion and by relating these findings to the motivation stated in the Introduction.\n(Papers reporting something other than experiments, such as a new method or technology, typically have different sections in their body, but they include the same Introduction and Conclusion sections as described above.)\n\nAlthough the above structure reflects the progression of most research projects, effective papers typically break the chronology in at least three ways to present their content in the order in which the audience will most likely want to read it. First and foremost, they summarize the motivation for, and the outcome of, the work in an abstract, located before the Introduction. In a sense, they reveal the beginning and end of the story — briefly — before providing the full story. Second, they move the more detailed, less important parts of the body to the end of the paper in one or more appendices so that these parts do not stand in the readers' way. Finally, they structure the content in the body in theorem-proof fashion, stating first what readers must remember (for example, as the first sentence of a paragraph) and then presenting evidence to support this statement.\n\n## The introduction\n\n This is a chapter from Jean-luc Doumont's book, Trees, maps and theorems.\n View Full-Size Image An effective introduction for a paper\n\nThe introduction reproduced here exhibits the four components that readers find useful as they begin to read a paper.\nIn the Introduction section, state the motivation for the work presented in your paper and prepare readers for the structure of the paper. Write four components, probably (but not necessarily) in four paragraphs: context, need, task, and object of the document.\n* First, provide some context to orient those readers who are less familiar with your topic and to establish the importance of your work.\n* Second, state the need for your work, as an opposition between what the scientific community currently has and what it wants.\n* Third, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).\n* Finally, preview the remainder of the paper to mentally prepare readers for its structure, in the object of the document.\n\n### Context and need\n\nAt the beginning of the Introduction section, the context and need work together as a funnel: They start broad and progressively narrow down to the issue addressed in the paper. To spark interest among your audience — referees and journal readers alike — provide a compelling motivation for the work presented in your paper: The fact that a phenomenon has never been studied before is not, in and of itself, a reason to study that phenomenon.\n\nWrite the context in a way that appeals to a broad range of readers and leads into the need. Do not include context for the sake of including context: Rather, provide only what will help readers better understand the need and, especially, its importance. Consider anchoring the context in time, using phrases such as recently, in the past 10 years, or since the early 1990s. You may also want to anchor your context in space (either geographically or within a given research field).\n\nConvey the need for the work as an opposition between actual and desired situations. Start by stating the actual situation (what we have) as a direct continuation of the context. If you feel you must explain recent achievements in much detail — say, in more than one or two paragraphs — consider moving the details to a section titled State of the art (or something similar) after the Introduction, but do provide a brief idea of the actual situation in the Introduction. Next, state the desired situation (what we want). Emphasize the contrast between the actual and desired situations with such words as but, however, or unfortunately.\n\nOne elegant way to express the desired part of the need is to combine it with the task in a single sentence. This sentence expresses first the objective, then the action undertaken to reach this objective, thus creating a strong and elegant connection between need and task. Here are three examples of such a combination:\n\n* To confirm this assumption, we studied the effects of a range of inhibitors of connexin channels . . . on . . .\n\n* To assess whether such multiple-coil sensors perform better than single-signal ones, we tested two of them — the DuoPXK and the GEMM3 — in a field where . . .\n\n* To form a better view of the global distribution and infectiousness of this pathogen, we examined 1645 postmetamorphic and adult amphibians collected from 27 countries between 1984 and 2006 for the presence of . . .\n\n### Task and object\nAn Introduction is usually clearer and more logical when it separates what the authors have done (the task) from what the paper itself attempts or covers (the object of the document). In other words, the task clarifies your contribution as a scientist, whereas the object of the document prepares readers for the structure of the paper, thus allowing focused or selective reading.\n\nFor the task,\n\n* use whoever did the work (normally, you and your colleagues) as the subject of the sentence: we or perhaps the authors;\n* use a verb expressing a research action: measured, calculated, etc.;\n* set that verb in the past tense.\n\nThe three examples below are well-formed tasks.\n\n* To confirm this assumption, we studied the effects of a range of inhibitors of connexin channels, such as the connexin mimetic peptides Gap26 and Gap27 and anti-peptide antibodies, on calcium signaling in cardiac cells and HeLa cells expressing connexins.\n\n* During controlled experiments, we investigated the influence of the HMP boundary conditions on liver flows.\n\n* To tackle this problem, we developed a new software verification technique called oblivious hashing, which calculates the hash values based on the actual execution of the program.\n\nThe list below provides examples of verbs that express research actions:\n\napply \nWe applied Laklöter's principle to . . . \nassess\tWe assessed the effects of larger doses of . . .\ncalculate \nWe calculated the photoluminescence spectrum of . . . \ncompare\tWe compared the effects of . . . to those of . . .\ncompute\tWe computed the velocity predicted by . . .\nderive\tWe derived a new set of rules for . . .\ndesign\tWe designed a series of experiments to . . .\ndetermine\tWe determined the complete nucleotide sequence of . . . \ndevelop\tWe developed a new algorithm to . . .\nevaluate\tWe evaluated the efficacy and biocompatibility of . . .\nexplore\tWe explored the relationship between . . .\nimplement\tWe implemented a genetic algorithm for . . .\ninvestigate\tWe investigated the behavior of . . .\nmeasure\tWe measured the concentration of cadmium in . . .\nmodel\tWe modeled the diffraction behavior of . . .\nFor the object of the document,\n\nuse the document itself as the subject of the sentence: this paper, this letter, etc.;\nuse a verb expressing a communication action: presents, summarizes, etc.;\nset the verb in the present tense.\nThe three examples below are suitable objects of the document for the three tasks shown above, respectively.\n\nThis paper clarifies the role of CxHc on calcium oscillations in neonatal cardiac myocytes and calcium transients induced by ATP in HL-cells originated from cardiac atrium and in HeLa cells expressing connexin 43 or 26.\n\nThis paper presents the flow effects induced by increasing the hepatic-artery pressure and by obstructing the vena cava inferior.\n\nThis paper discusses the theory behind oblivious hashing and shows how this approach can be applied for local software tamper resistance and remote code authentication.\n\nThe list below provides examples of verbs that express communication actions:\n\nclarify \nThis paper clarifies the role of soils in . . .\ndescribe\tThis paper describes the mechanism by which . . .\ndetail\tThis paper details the algorithm used for . . .\ndiscuss\tThis paper discusses the influence of acidity on . . .\nexplain\tThis paper explains how the new encoding scheme . . .\noffer\tThis paper offers four recommendations for . . .\npresent\tThis paper presents the results of . . .\nproposes\tThis paper proposes a set of guidelines for . . .\nprovide\tThis paper provides the complete framework and . . .\nreport\tThis paper reports on our progress so far . . .\nsummarize\tThis paper summarizes our results for 27 patients with . . .\nThe body\nEven the most logical structure is of little use if readers do not see and understand it as they progress through a paper. Thus, as you organize the body of your paper into sections and perhaps subsections, remember to prepare your readers for the structure ahead at all levels. You already do so for the overall structure of the body (the sections) in the object of the document at the end of the Introduction. You can similarly prepare your readers for an upcoming division into subsections by introducing a global paragraph between the heading of a section and the heading of its first subsection. This paragraph can contain any information relating to the section as a whole rather than particular subsections, but it should at least announce the subsections, whether explicitly or implicitly. An explicit preview would be phrased much like the object of the document: \"This section first . . . , then . . . , and finally . . . \"\n\nAlthough papers can be organized into sections in many ways, those reporting experimental work typically include Materials and Methods, Results, and Discussion in their body. In any case, the paragraphs in these sections should begin with a topic sentence to prepare readers for their contents, allow selective reading, and — ideally — get a message across.\n\n## Materials and methods\n This is a chapter from Jean-luc Doumont's book, Trees, maps and theorems.\n View Full-Size Image A paragraph of materials and methods\nThis paragraph of materials and methods expresses the main idea first, in a topic sentence, so readers immediately know what it is about.\nMost Materials and Methods sections are boring to read, yet they need not be. To make this section interesting, explain the choices you made in your experimental procedure: What justifies using a given compound, concentration, or dimension? What is special, unexpected, or different in your approach? Mention these things early in your paragraph, ideally in the first sentence. If you use a standard or usual procedure, mention that upfront, too. Do not make readers guess: Make sure the paragraph's first sentence gives them a clear idea of what the entire paragraph is about. If you feel you cannot or need not do more than list items, consider using a table or perhaps a schematic diagram rather than a paragraph of text.\n\n## Results and discussion\n This is a chapter from Jean-luc Doumont's book, Trees, maps and theorems.\n View Full-Size Image A paragraph of results and discussion\nThis paragraph of results and discussion (above) can easily be rewritten (below) to convey the message first, not last.\nThe traditional Results and Discussion sections are best combined because results make little sense to most readers without interpretation.\nWhen reporting and discussing your results, do not force your readers to go through everything you went through in chronological order. Instead, state the message of each paragraph upfront: Convey in the first sentence what you want readers to remember from the paragraph as a whole. Focus on what happened, not on the fact that you observed it. Then develop your message in the remainder of the paragraph, including only that information you think you need to convince your audience.\n\n## The conclusion\n This is a chapter from Jean-luc Doumont's book, Trees, maps and theorems.\n View Full-Size Image An effective conclusion from a paper\nThis paragraph of results and discussion (above) can easily be rewritten (below) to convey the message first, not last.\nIn the Conclusion section, state the most important outcome of your work. Do not simply summarize the points already made in the body — instead, interpret your findings at a higher level of abstraction. Show whether, or to what extent, you have succeeded in addressing the need stated in the Introduction. At the same time, do not focus on yourself (for example, by restating everything you did). Rather, show what your findings mean to readers. Make the Conclusion interesting and memorable for them.\nAt the end of your Conclusion, consider including perspectives — that is, an idea of what could or should still be done in relation to the issue addressed in the paper. If you include perspectives, clarify whether you are referring to firm plans for yourself and your colleagues (\"In the coming months, we will . . . \") or to an invitation to readers (\"One remaining question is . . . \").\n\nIf your paper includes a well-structured Introduction and an effective abstract, you need not repeat any of the Introduction in the Conclusion. In particular, do not restate what you have done or what the paper does. Instead, focus on what you have found and, especially, on what your findings mean. Do not be afraid to write a short Conclusion section: If you can conclude in just a few sentences given the rich discussion in the body of the paper, then do so. (In other words, resist the temptation to repeat material from the Introduction just to make the Conclusion longer under the false belief that a longer Conclusion will seem more impressive.)\n\n## The abstract\n This is a chapter from Jean-luc Doumont's book, Trees, maps and theorems.\n View Full-Size Image An effective abstract\nIn just under 200 words, the abstract reproduced here conveys the motivation for and the outcome of the work with some accuracy but without intimidating readers by its length.\nThe readers of a scientific paper read the abstract for two purposes: to decide whether they want to (acquire and) read the full paper, and to prepare themselves for the details presented in that paper. An effective abstract helps readers achieve these two purposes. In particular, because it is typically read before the full paper, the abstract should present what the readers are primarily interested in; that is, what they want to know first of all and most of all.\nTypically, readers are primarily interested in the information presented in a paper's Introduction and Conclusion sections. Primarily, they want to know the motivation for the work presented and the outcome of this work. Then (and only then) the most specialized among them might want to know the details of the work. Thus, an effective abstract focuses on motivation and outcome; in doing so, it parallels the paper's Introduction and Conclusion.\n\nAccordingly, you can think of an abstract as having two distinct parts — motivation and outcome — even if it is typeset as a single paragraph. For the first part, follow the same structure as the Introduction section of the paper: State the context, the need, the task, and the object of the document. For the second part, mention your findings (the what) and, especially, your conclusion (the so what — that is, the interpretation of your findings); if appropriate, end with perspectives, as in the Conclusion section of your paper.\n\nAlthough the structure of the abstract parallels the Introduction and Conclusion sections, it differs from these sections in the audience it addresses. The abstract is read by many different readers, from the most specialized to the least specialized among the target audience. In a sense, it should be the least specialized part of the paper. Any scientist reading it should be able to understand why the work was carried out and why it is important (context and need), what the authors did (task) and what the paper reports about this work (object of the document), what the authors found (findings), what these findings mean (the conclusion), and possibly what the next steps are (perspectives). In contrast, the full paper is typically read by specialists only; its Introduction and Conclusion are more detailed (that is, longer and more specialized) than the abstract.\n\nAn effective abstract stands on its own — it can be understood fully even when made available without the full paper. To this end, avoid referring to figures or the bibliography in the abstract.

However I need to find a solution to efficiently share private notes as html files.\n\nThe remote notes :\n\n- [ ] should be accessible by a simple link, no download required\n- [ ] should rendered the exact same way as the dendrons published notes\n- [ ] should be versionable by git or similar\n- [ ] should be automatically updated upon local changes\n- [ ] should be self encapsulated (if i have them hosted on a git the user whith the link to note C should not be able to jump to upper levels or see note A)\n\n\n## Task (of the note/paragraph/text/paper/project)\n\nThis is what I did up to now and what I plan to do to tackle this\n\n- [x] ~~recreated this ctno snippet~~\n\n- [x] ~~created this note~~\n\n- [ ] check for hosting solutions\n\n    - [x] ~~dropbox~~\n\n    Not good anymore as the discontinued the direct disply of html files.

Individual molecules\n\nYou can name molecules by using the Naming menu entry of Tools menu in MarvinView, or Structure > Structure to Name > Generate Name in MarvinSketch.\nIn MarvinSketch, the name can be added to the canvas by using the Structure to Name > Place IUPAC Name entry in the Structure menu. The name will be displayed below the molecule, and updated in real-time when the molecule is modified.\n\n## Batch naming\n\nNaming of a large number of molecules contained in a file can be achieved in two ways: with MarvinView, and on the command line, with molconvert. In both cases, all formats supported by Marvin are acceptable as input.\nWith MarvinView, open the file containing the structures to be names. Then select the menu File/Save As, and choose \"IUPAC Name files\" in the \"Files of type\" drop-down box. Choose a name for the file, and click on the Save button. The file will contain the names of the structures, one per line.\n\nAlternatively, on the command line, you can use the following command:\n\n`molconvert name inputs.mol -o names.txt`\n\nThe file names.txt will contain the names of the molecules in the input file, with one name per line.\n\nIt is possible to use a format option to chose a nomenclature style:\n\ni (default) uses the IUPAC rules for preferred names;\nt uses a more traditional style.\n\nFor instance, to generate traditional names, use the following:\n\n`molconvert name:t inputs.mol -o names.txt`\n\nGenerate all common names for a structure:\n\n`molconvert \"name:common,all\" -s tylenol`\n\nGenerate the most popular common name for a structure (It fails if none is known.):\n\n`molconvert name:common -s viagra`\n\nAdding names as an additional field to a SDfile can be achieved with the cxcalc tool.\n\n`cxcalc -S name input.sdf -o named.sdf`\n\n## API\n\nFor information about how names can be generated from Java programs, see the developer documentation.\n\n## References\n\nIUPAC Provisional Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry\n\n\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/d5773060-e149-4a41-b4fd-5827e821c822.html","relUrl":"notes/d5773060-e149-4a41-b4fd-5827e821c822.html"},{"doc":"Dendron","title":"Dendron","hpath":"tools.dendron","content":"\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/1709e82d-b8a6-4217-a42e-34a072fe0e39.html","relUrl":"notes/1709e82d-b8a6-4217-a42e-34a072fe0e39.html"},{"doc":"Tags","title":"Tags","hpath":"tools.dendron.tags","content":"\n#course_material ~~check tag system in dendron ~~\n\nShortcut for tags is # \nso [[#tag|tag.tag]]\n\n\nCheck and explore tags / backlinks system in Dendron\n\n2021-01-10 21:59\n\nSo actually looking at https://dendron.so/notes/8bc9b3f1-8508-4d3a-a2de-be9f12ef1821.html it appears that the way to tag a note is just exactly the same as the way you would link it.\nLets try both with an existing tag/note and an unexisting on.\n\nExisting is [[tools.organization.digitalgardens]] and non existing is [[spatial.exploration]].\n\nPretty version [[#explo|spatial.explo]]\n\n\n ---\n\n //TODO Sublime ZK-like tag system.

So, I combine my inferences using the beeps and my prior information about the locations I have misplaced the phone in the past to identify an area I must search to locate the phone.\n\n\nResponse two is of interest also !\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/a/1602\n\n\nA Bayesian is one who, vaguely expecting a horse, and catching\na glimpse of a donkey, strongly believes he has seen a mule\n\nStephen Senn, Statistician & Bayesian Skeptic (mostly)\n\nhttps://faculty.washington.edu/kenrice/BayesIntroClassEpi2018.pdf\n\n\n# Application to Mandelbrot project\nBayesian are especially powerful for functional optimization.\nIn the frame of the mandelbrot project we could try to functionalize our drug discovery quest < this alone is a big part of the problem. \n\n- an ensemble of molecules found to be present in various amount in plants displaying a high inhibitory activity and a low cytotoxicity.\n- the more this ensemble of molecules is restricted and unique to the highly bioactive plants, the more they are the potential responsible of this bioactivity.\n- some priors could be defined: we know that scaffold X and Y usually display these activities.\n\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/80c4f709-39bd-47e3-949f-82f4c37e6413.html","relUrl":"notes/80c4f709-39bd-47e3-949f-82f4c37e6413.html"},{"doc":"Ool","title":"Ool","hpath":"knowledge.ool","content":"\n# Origins of Life\n\nSome papers and ressources of interest on Origin of Life research\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/c198018d-523a-447d-beff-5aaa9c729545.html","relUrl":"notes/c198018d-523a-447d-beff-5aaa9c729545.html"},{"doc":"Metabolism","title":"Metabolism","hpath":"knowledge.metabolism","content":"\n# Metabolism\n\nWiki definition here https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tabolisme\nInteresting facts there\n\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/c5cafbdb-975d-4d92-b2d7-0ed537962934.html","relUrl":"notes/c5cafbdb-975d-4d92-b2d7-0ed537962934.html"},{"doc":"Public","title":"Public","hpath":"public","content":"\n","url":"https://oolonek.github.io/dendron-private/notes/e6ea3846-26e0-45f8-8407-94febaa77154.html","relUrl":"notes/e6ea3846-26e0-45f8-8407-94febaa77154.html"},{"doc":"Pledge","title":"Pledge","hpath":"pledge","content":"\n# About\n\nThis dendrite contains materials about things I am publicly committed to.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you build, organize, and share knowledge bases of any size.\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1. Launch the _command bar_ inside vscode:\n    - Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n    - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n    - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n2.
